What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
    When you initialize a repository all the necessary attributes and
    metadata are assigned to it. Once you do that, the system can start
    to follow the status of your repository and you can start to use the 
    necessary tools (commits, logs, ...) to operate on your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value du you think it offers?
    Staging area is like a limbo between working directory and repository.
    You need to choose what files to commit and if commit multiple files.
    Staging area provide you with the opportunity of actively choosing
    what files to include in next commit (snapshot) before these snapshots
    are being made. Not all files in the working direcory are neccesarily
    intended to be tracked, so that's why you need a seperate staging area
    before commiting files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
 change?
    I can make changes to several files in my working directory, but
    I can add them one by one to the staging area and commit them one by one,
    so that I execute the principle of making one commit per logical change in
    one or more closely related files.
