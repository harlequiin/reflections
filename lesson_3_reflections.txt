When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I'd want to use a remote repository for example when I'm collaborating on a bigger
  project with multiple contributors or when I want to make a visible project which could 
  potentially attract some contributors. Also - having a remote repository helps in case
  of technical errors (computer breaks down, or you have to replace it, ...).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because I might be developing some features which could interfere with some freshly
  made changes to remote (by me or some other contributor), so constant updates from
  remote might become a nuisance and can be annoying - Git doesn't know when I have
  finished making a stable feature etc., it also may inadvertantly add some new branches
  that I didn't want, so it's better to leave pulling or pushing changes up to me
  (programmer).
