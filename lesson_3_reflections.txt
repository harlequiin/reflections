When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I'd want to use a remote repository for example when I'm collaborating on abigger
  project with multiple contributors or when I want to make a visible project which could 
  potentially attract some contributors. Also - having a remote repository helps in case
  of technical errors (computer breaks down, or you have to replace it, ...).
